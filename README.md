# Buy It For Life and help ease pressure on Earth's resource exploitation

Global consumerism dictates that you have to buy new things every year to stay trendy and "help" them stay in business. I and many others on the subreddit [r/BuyItForLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) disagree. This repo is a collection of highly durable, quality-made products that you buy once and keep using until you can or pass them to the next generation. 

_This list is made of recommendations I came across on Reddit and from friends and family. Everybody is welcome to submit their pull request, which will be reviewed to help fight the spam._
